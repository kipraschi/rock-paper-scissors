# The Odin Project Foundations Course practice:
Rock Paper Scissors game. First JavaScript project.

<a href="https://kipraschi.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/"> -> Live Demo <- </a>

Main things I've learned when creating this page:
- How to use DOM manipulation and event listeners in JavaScript.
- How to make a pop-up window (modal).
- Some additional CSS attributes such as transition, opacity and pointer-events.
